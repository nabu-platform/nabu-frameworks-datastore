TODO: the idea was that you could set more arbitrary windows (e.g. 2 days instead of daily)
This means however we need to combine all the files of the hit into a single zip which is contrary to how it is currently structured (we break when no longer in the window, and otherwise we proceed)
It would require extensive refactoring to enable this and it seems unlikely to be very important so currently we leave it as is which means you can only choose yearly, monthly or daily
